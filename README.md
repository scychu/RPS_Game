This is THE ODIN PROJECT for web development 101 "PROJECT ROCK PAPER GAMES" I'm sure there are a lot of mistakes or better code to make this game but i'm quite proud to make this RPS Game. I'll try my best to keep learning and becoming even more better in the future.

Introduction:

The player can choose between 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.
The winner will get a poin for their score.
The game will have 5 rounds and will show the score for the user and computer and who is the winner.
User may choose to play again or not.
